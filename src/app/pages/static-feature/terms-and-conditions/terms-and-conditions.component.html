            18.1 The Company may, at its sole discretion, refuse to register and provide a User Account to anyone and

            this Agreement shall be interpreted as if such provision was so excluded and shall be enforceable in
            accordance with its terms; provided, however, that in such event this Agreement shall be interpreted so as
            to give effect, to the greatest extent consistent with and permitted by applicable law, to the meaning and
            intention of the excluded provision as determined by such court of competent jurisdiction.
