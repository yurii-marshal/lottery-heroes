    "superenalotto": "<h1 itemprop='name'>Super Big Wins with SuperEnalotto</h1> <p itemprop='description'>SuperEnalotto is an Italian lottery with a loyal and fiery fan base in its home country. It has some special rules that come from a storied history with an Italian twist. The SuperEnalotto was created in 1997, and like today had only six digits to play, each coming from the first number drawn in a smaller lottery shared by six cities around Italy: Rome, Naples, Palermo, Milan, Florence and Bari. Now, all six come during the same draw, and there are no special extra numbers to pick, only six number from 1 to 90.</p> <p>The other idea that makes this \"superlotto\" special is that the odds, combined with a no-limit feature have created enormous nine-figure jackpots that are special for this single-country game. The biggest SuperEnalotto jackpot was over €177 million, which is almost double the biggest jackpot of the <a routerLink='/eurojackpot' title='EuroJackpot'>EuroJackpot</a> - a lotto that spans over 17 countries!</p> <h2>The SuperEnalotto Odds</h2> <p>SuperEnalotto odds are lower than competing <a routerLink='/lotteries' title='lotteries' itemprop='significantLink'>lotteries</a>, which keeps the jackpot rolling over and over again! This is why for a relatively small national lottery; the jackpots get truly gigantic. The odds of hitting the SuperEnalotto jackpot are 1 in 622,000,000, and if you're wondering what the chances are of winning other sums, your answer is just 1 in 318. Keep in mind that the other prizes are still very impressive.</p> <h2>The SuperEnalotto Jackpot</h2> <p>The no-cap, no-limit SuperEnalotto jackpot gets very big, to put it mildly. These jackpots are famous for casting a shadow over the prizes from lotteries with more countries and players, and always make their winners fabulously wealthy. They are also not taxed, which makes them popular among, well, just about everyone!</p> <p>SuperEnalotto also takes the cake for one of the biggest single-winner jackpots of all time, even among <a routerLink='/mega-millions' title='Mega Millions' itemprop='significantLink'>Mega Millions</a>, <a routerLink='/powerball' title='Powerball' itemprop='significantLink'>Powerball</a> and other giants. One person won more than €147 million recently, free to share (or not share) with whoever he pleases!</p> <h2>SuperEnalotto Draw Time</h2> <p>This game truly keeps people on their toes. The <a routerLink='/superenalotto/results' title='SuperEnalotto winning numbers'>SuperEnalotto winning numbers</a> are drawn three days a week - one of the few lotteries to do so, and on Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday no less.
